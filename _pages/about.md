I am Yuxuan Zong, a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the Institut des Systèmes Intelligents et de Robotique (ISIR) at Sorbonne University (SU), supervised under [Benjamin Piwowarski](https://www.piwowarski.fr/). Graduation expected in October 2025. 

I am interested in information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP) with the interaction of the Transformer-based models.

Resources
======

I have participated in creating the following resources: 
* [XpmIR](https://github.com/experimaestro/experimaestro-ir) providing components for launching basic IR experiments, based on [experimaestro](https://github.com/experimaestro/experimaestro-python).
* a [code repository](https://git.isir.upmc.fr/mat_vast/cross_domain_adaptation) providing the experimenting and reproducing scripts for the work **Simple Domain Adaptation for Sparse Retrievers**, under the framework of [XpmIR](https://github.com/experimaestro/experimaestro-ir).

I have also contributed to key open-source toolkits in IR, including: 
* [ir-datasets](https://github.com/allenai/ir_datasets/), a python toolkit for accessing the dataset of the IR tasks.
* [datamaestro_text](https://github.com/experimaestro/datamaestro_text/), a python toolkit for prepare the data record for IR, especially used for [XpmIR](https://github.com/experimaestro/experimaestro-ir).
